## Rails Facebook App :diamonds: 
This project is a simple Facebook app developed with the framework Ruby on Rails, which includes the main features: registration, news feed, friendships requests, accepting friendship requests, deleting friends, posts, comments, and likes. We also implemented the optional sign-in with real Facebook by using Omniauth and Devise. In the future, other characteristics can be added.
